      <h1>Poets of tomorrow’s world</h1>
      <p>
        In the distant future Earth's surface got toxic and the air became
        polluted. In an attempt to survive humans built life-scrapers - giant
        buildings going high into the sky where it was still possible to live.
        People call them towers. Money and power are the two factors that define
        your fate. The more you have, the higher level of the life-scraper you
        can reach, and thus increase your chances for a longer life. The closer
        you are to the surface, the faster you die.<br /><br />Pollution and
        toxins are slowly growing and getting up. One day they will finally
        reach the top levels of the highest towers.<br /><br />Towers are not
        big enough to deal with the birth rate and it’s heavily regulated.
        Movement between the towers is almost impossible. Only the richest ones
        have a chance to travel and visit other life-scrapers.<br /><br />Each
        tower is a separate state while all of them are ruled by the Builders
        Council. They planned and constructed all of them back in the days and
        their dynasty defines humans' fate since then. They are located at the
        top of the main life-scraper called the Pillar.<br /><br />Not having
        much space, jobs and activities in the real world, humans spent most of
        the time in the virtual one. It’s a global network called zerOne, a
        virtual representation of the tower you live in. It has more space but
        is still restricted in terms of getting higher or lower. Your financial
        situation is the main factor that can remove some restrictions.
        Connections with other towers are blocked, although there are some ways
        to bypass it.<br /><br />In the times not long before the tower’s era
        most of the Earth’s population became coders who call themselves
        writers. The profession became so popular that it led to almost full
        replacement of all other labor by robots programmed by writers.<br /><br />Most
        of the human’s jobs were replaced by machines.<br /><br />Currently
        manual labor has ceased to exist. The Builders Council controls the
        robots production and writers guilds compete for each sector where
        robots are being used. Coders manage their work, fix bugs and develop
        new features. However, the need for it is significantly less than the
        population numbers. Every writer's guild is constantly full and even
        within them only the best ones manage to stay and continue working
        there.<br /><br />Those who are not able to work in the robot industry
        search for various sources of income in zerOne. The most popular ones
        are the Writers Fights. These are virtual fighting arenas where coders
        need to create artificial characters from scratch during the match.
        These characters then fight each other in virtual space. Participants
        call themselves poets. Mostly because for the majority each fight is the
        last frontier between the lower and higher tower’s levels. They call it
        the Last Song. Sometimes you sing it before getting on the previous
        level and sometimes before getting on the next one.
