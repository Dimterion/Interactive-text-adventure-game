UPDATE: I've remade this project and it's current version can be seen [here](https://poets-of-tomorrows-world.vercel.app/) (and the new repo is [here](https://github.com/Dimterion/PoTW)).

# Poets of tomorrowâ€™s world

A small personal project of mine. I was more interested in its contents rather than technical side. Just a story I wanted to write with some interactivity and put into HTML format to test some techniques I've learnt.

[This guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1S_NhKkvGA&list=PLvHjogly_3JPuPbgzkBK6BmM5SJynzJb_&index=14) from Web Dev Simplified was used as an example to create this.
